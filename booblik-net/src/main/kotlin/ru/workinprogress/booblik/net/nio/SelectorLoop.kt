/**
 * Turns NIO readiness into something a coroutine can await.
 *
 * This exists because of decision Р3. Ktor's socket API hands out a `ByteChannel` and keeps the
 * `SocketChannel` to itself, and `FileChannel.transferTo` needs the real channel — so a broker that
 * wants `sendfile` has to own its own readiness engine. This is that engine, and it is deliberately
 * the smallest one that works: register interest, wait, resume.
 *
 * ## Why interest changes are queued
 *
 * `SelectionKey.interestOps` from another thread while `select()` is in progress is, depending on
 * the platform, either blocking or silently ineffective. Every change is therefore posted to a
 * queue and applied by the loop thread itself, which then means the loop has to be woken — hence
 * the [Selector.wakeup] after each post. Skipping that wakeup does not fail; it hangs, once, under
 * load, in a way that looks like a slow client.
